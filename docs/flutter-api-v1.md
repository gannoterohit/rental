# ApnaNest Flutter API v1

Base URL: `/api/v1`

Send `Accept: application/json` on every request. Authenticated requests also send:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SANCTUM_TOKEN
```

Successful JSON responses use:

```json
{"status":"success","message":"...","data":{}}
```

Business modules paused by admin return HTTP `503`:

```json
{"status":"unavailable","message":"...","reason":"payments"}
```

Possible reasons: `maintenance`, `registration`, `listings`, `payments`, `owner_panel`, `user_panel`.

## Upload limits

- Avatar: image, maximum 2 MB.
- Complaint evidence/reply attachment: JPG, PNG, WebP or PDF, maximum 5 MB.
- Room upload rules are returned through validation errors and should be displayed against each Flutter form field.

## Important app behavior

- Store the Sanctum token using secure device storage.
- After login, route by `data.user.role` (`user` or `owner`).
- On HTTP `401`, clear the token and open login.
- On HTTP `403`, show the API message; do not retry automatically.
- On HTTP `422`, map `errors` to form fields.
- On HTTP `503`, display the maintenance/module message and keep unaffected app modules usable.

## Admin Flutter APIs

Admin base path: `/api/v1/admin`. Login uses the normal OTP login endpoint; the returned account must have `role=admin` and `is_staff_active=true`. Every endpoint enforces the staff member's role permissions.

### Dashboard, people and listings

- `GET /admin/dashboard`, `/admin/analytics`, `/admin/search-analytics`
- `GET /admin/users`, `GET /admin/users/{id}`, `POST /admin/users/{id}/toggle-block`
- `GET /admin/owners`, `POST /admin/owners`, `GET /admin/owners/{id}`
- `POST /admin/owners/{id}/toggle-block`
- `PUT /admin/owners/{id}/verification`
- `GET /admin/rooms`, approve/reject/delete room endpoints
- `POST /admin/rooms/bulk-action` with `room_ids[]` and action `approve`, `reject`, `suspend`, `activate` or `delete`
- Full rejection-reason and room-option CRUD endpoints

### Support

- Complaint list/detail/update/reply/reopen endpoints

### Staff security and audit

- `GET /admin/permission-catalog`
- Staff list/create/update/enable-disable endpoints
- Role list/create/update endpoints
- `GET /admin/activity-logs`

Every successful non-GET Admin API action is automatically written to the same activity log used by the web admin panel.

### Maintenance, reports and cleanup

- `GET|PUT /admin/maintenance` manages website and app availability from one place.
- `GET /admin/reports/overview?from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD`
- `DELETE /admin/search-logs/{id}` deletes one analytics record.
- `DELETE /admin/search-logs` accepts either `all=true` or a `from`/`to` date range.
